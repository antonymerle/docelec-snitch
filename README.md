# docelec-snitch

Academic libraries spend a lot (a LOT) of money on their electronic resources (Elsevier, Sage, Springer, etc.). They are plentiful and it can be hard to track them all and prevent downtimes caused by breaking links or other problems. When it happens, often time it is a patron who report the bug. Quite a long time may have passed until this report.
The purpose of docelec-snitch is to monitor all of the subscriptions, report any problem to a human operator so that access can be restored as quick as possible.
